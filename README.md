# Movie Browser

## About

This is the code for a movie browser app written in React Native, which works on both Android an iOS devices. It can be ran through an emulator on the browser located [here](https://snack.expo.dev/@hatanh/movie-browser).

This project that started off as an assignment from a CS50 online class taken outside of my normal university classes. I wrote all of the functions myself and so it should contain, if any, a minimal amount of template code. 

Uses the free and public open movie database api ([OMDb](https://www.omdbapi.com/))
